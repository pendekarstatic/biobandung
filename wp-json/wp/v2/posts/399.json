And have now begun to enter the homes of ordinary people such as you and my grandma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major companies such as Apple and Facebook have made 3D technology available to the masses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple <\/strong>has implemented augmented reality on their own website so you can browse the products from the comfort of your home. The newest devices such as the iPad Pro even has a built-in LiDAR sensor which can capture the depth of the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sees and thereby actually generates 3D representations of your home or objects in your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https:\/\/triggergrowth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Ipad-pro-lidar-new.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-415\"\/><figcaption>Image by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=09_QxCcBEyU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facebook <\/strong>launched their Oculus Quest last year, which makes virtual reality gaming and entertainment consumption available to the masses. It won\u2019t be long before virtual and augmented reality become a more integrated part of our daily lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example of how Oculus Quest works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Oculus Quest Basics Tutorial\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pVFcsedWsKE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can Photogrammetry help you create 3D content?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a business, how are you supposed to start creating 3D content? That\u2019s the question many people might ask themselves if they are looking to explore this new opportunity. I\u2019m going to introduce you to one of the many ways of creating 3D content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photogrammetry is the name of the technology that allows you to create 3D objects from a series of regular 2D images.<\/strong> Basically, you will have to walk around the object and take pictures of it carefully. It's crucial to get each and every inch of your object from every single angle at a steady pace, making sure that you don\u2019t shake the camera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Photogrammetry - 3D scan with just your phone\/camera\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ye-C-OOFsX8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining images into an object takes some advanced software that you can run on either your computer or on the mobile device. You might even be able to do it in the cloud using advanced cloud services that can stitch the images together into the 3D object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is still fairly complex technology. When you capture all the images and combine them into 3D objects, you will definitely spend a certain amount of time on polishing everything out. However, it is still a major improvement in terms of how much time is spent on creating 3D models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Particularly in making realistic models with photorealistic texturing and materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\">\n    <iframe title=\"A 3D model\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\"src=\"https:\/\/sketchfab.com\/models\/f8efa3b21ab343b5a3d25e14c0173f59\/embed?preload=1&amp;ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>With modern 3D ready JavaScript libraries such as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/threejs.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">three.js<\/a>, you can present and interact with 3D objects In any browser on any mobile device. Or if you wanna make it really exciting, you can make the object viewable in a VR or AR headset using WebXR ready JavaScript libraries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine capturing your products into 3D objects in a matter of hours, not days, and sending them to your customers across the globe in VR headsets. Best of all, this approach would cost less than the plane ticket for them to visit your factory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is a great opportunity that can lower your sales-related cost and improve the experience for your customers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprise-level sales of complex machinery to customers who sit in the comfort of their own homes, what an exciting world we live in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re curious to learn how you can embark on this journey of web-based sales please do not hesitate to reach out to us. <strong>We would be happy to introduce you to some of the available technologies and help you in the right direction.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality have crossed the hype curve long ago.
