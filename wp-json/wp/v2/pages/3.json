We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \"tracking pixels\" or \"clear gifs\"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e\u00admail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-\u00adparty website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e\u00admail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"do-you-serve-targeted-advertising\"><\/span>Do you serve targeted advertising?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites.

This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-rights-you-have-over-your-data\"><\/span>What Rights You Have Over Your Data<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Users that have an account on this site, or have left comments, may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by Trigger Growth.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.<\/strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Object to processing of their data.<\/strong> Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Access their Data.<\/strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by Trigger Growth, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.<\/strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restrict the processing of their data.<\/strong> Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their data.
